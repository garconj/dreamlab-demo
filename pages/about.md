## The DreamLab for June 2022!!!

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

## The Project
The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
